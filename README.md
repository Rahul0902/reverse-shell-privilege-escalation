<h1>Reverse Shell & Privilege Escalation</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<a href='https://tryhackme.com/room/rrootme'>RootMe Challenge - TryHackMe</a><br><br>

<h3>Reconnaissance</h3>
I initiated an nmap scan to unveil active ports. Port 80 was open, showcasing HTTP, and port 22 revealed itself as accessible via SSH.<br><br>

Next, utilising the gobuster tool, I unearthed a hidden directory named /panel/. This covert path presented an intriguing opportunityâ€”a file upload feature perfect for deploying my reverse shell.<br><br>

<h3>Obtaining A Shell</h3>

I found a reverse shell here: <a href= 'https://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell'>Pentestmonkey Reverse Shell</a> which I downloaded, and configured the file to utilise my IP and port 4444.<br><br>

The site does not allow you to upload .php files but fortunatley allows .php5. I was able to upload the file 'payload.php5' containing the reverse shell.<br><br>

Launching a netcat listener on port 4444, I activated the payload.php5 within the site's uploads.<br><br>

<h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>
With a foothold secured I searched for files with SUID permission, and was able to identify the file /usr/bin/python.<br><br>

From here I leveraged a gtfobins privilege escalation method and ran this within my shell.<br><br>

The two flags I needed to identify where found in a root.txt and user.txt file. The root.txt file was within the root directory and I was able to find the user.txt file by running a find command.<br><br>
